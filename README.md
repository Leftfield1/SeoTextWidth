Hold onto your hats (and meta descriptions)! This ain't your average snooze-fest README. Buckle up for a wild ride through the world of ProcessWire modules!

This little gem of a module calculates text width exactly how Google's SERP (fancy talk for Search Engine Results Page) wants it. No more guessing games!  We're also talking meta titles and descriptions, those make-or-break snippets that determine if someone clicks on your website or gets hypnotized by a cat video.

It loads on every page in the backend. It calculate the text width in two fields, in my case the fields are named "seo" and "desc". First one for meta title and the second one for meta description. If you have other names for these two fields, you have to edit JavaScript and CSS file and manually change part of IDs. Hope it will help! If there will be any updates, I will post it here. Happy ProcessWiring!

But wait, there's more! (cue dramatic music) This bad boy comes with a JavaScript file, but don't worry, you're not stuck with it out-of-the-box. It's fully customizable to your whims and desires.  Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Don't go changing things willy-nilly and accidentally turn all your website text into emoji speak.

Now get out there and conquer those SERPs!

PS: Module is primitive.
